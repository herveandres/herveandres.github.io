I'm a PhD Student in Probability at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech. My research topic is "Real-World modelling and validation for applications in the insurance industry". 
My thesis is under a CIFRE agreement between CERMICS and Milliman. I work under the supervision of Benjamin Jourdain (CERMICS) and Alexandre Boumezoued (Milliman).
